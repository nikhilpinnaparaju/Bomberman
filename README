Hi, Welcome to my custom terminal based game of Bomberman.

The controls used are normal:-

W - Move Up
A - Move Left
S - Move Down
D - Move right
B - Plant Bomb
Q - Quit

Enemies are spawned at random locations and so are the bricks leading to multiple possible levels.

The game using threading and so it runs multiple parallel process at the same time hence not stopping the game's core mechanics such as enemy movement
or bomb countdown with the user does not provide input. This was the hardest part and took a lot of trials and implementations to make work.

OOPS concepts such as Modularity, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism have been used in this project creation.

Existing classes:-

Person
Bomberman
Bomb
Enemy
RepeatedTimer
Bricks
KillingFunction
MovingEnemies

The Code has been run on a terminal of Black Background, Please consider that will running game

Hope you enjoy the game.
Thanks in Advance.
